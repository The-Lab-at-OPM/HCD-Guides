## Add your people photos here

Please provide us a headshot that does its best to satisfy the following criteria.

* Shot from the waist up or closer, i.e. not originally a full-body photo thatâ€™s been cropped
* Shot in front of a solid or otherwise uncluttered background
* Lit by natural sunlight, either outdoors or near a window (or in a studio if you are fancy)
* If shot outdoors, not under the full midday sun which creates harsh highlights and shadows
* Exposed correctly: the photo shouldn't have any areas that are 100% white (blown out) or 100% black (under-exposed)
* Avoid sunglasses, headphones, hats. Just you!

### Naming your image

When you upload a person image to github please name it in the following format:

```
[first-last].[MIME type]
```

For example:

```
sean-baker.jpg
```

#### Connecting your image to your page

When you are done you need to add that same image filename to the front-matter of your person page using the key "image_name:". For example:

```
image_name: sean-baker.jpg
```
