# HCD-Guides

While design projects are not the typical project collaborated upon on the Github platform, much of our work can benefit from Github's structure and flow. If you are new to Github, please refer to this documentation to learn more: https://help.github.com/

## Printing
Files tagged PAGES are formatted for printing on an at-home printer on standard 8.5"x11" paper. 

Files tagged SPREADS are formatted to print as full page spreads on 11"x17" paper. On standard paper, these will appear tiny. Do not print these unless you are printing with 11"x17" pages. 

The HCD Discovery Operations Guide is formatted to be hole-punched with facing spreads. This is intentional. Please read the How to Use This Guide section for the logic and use of this asset.  

The HCD Discovery Guide is formatted as a booklet. To create a booklet, please consult your local professional printer.

## Updates / Revisions Requests

Please use GitHub's Issues tab to request changes as large as a suggested chapter addition or as small as a typo. These updates will be gathered and reviewed for future editions of the Guides. Please be as brief and clear as possible with your requests. While not all parts of this Code for America documentation on how to write a good issue are pertinent to the revision of a design project, it provides a good starting point: 

https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Good-GitHub-Issues.md. You can even use this template, to make it easier: https://bit.ly/2O6JsUb

Issues will be reviewed, but the authors and editors do not guarantee that the request will be integrated into future versions. 

Please contact LAB@opm.gov for more information on this work.
